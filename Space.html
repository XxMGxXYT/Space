            <p>The Milky Way[b] is the galaxy that includes our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance 
                from Earth: a hazy band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. 
                The term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek<span style="color:#56ff00;"> γαλακτικός κύκλος </span>(galaktikos kýklos),
                meaning "milky circle".[21][22][23] From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. 
                Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, 
                most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe.[24] Following the 1920 Great Debate 
                between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis,[25] observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies.</p>

                <p class="p1">The Solar System[c] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. 
                    It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. T
                    he vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter. 
                    The four inner system planets—<span style="color:#adcb9d;">Mercury</span>, <span style="color:#efdf4f;">Venus</span>, <span style="color:#0a7bef;">Earth</span> and <span style="color:#f17923;">Mars</span> —are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal.
                    The four giant planets of the outer system are substantially larger and more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, <span style="color:#e1cb61;">Jupiter</span> and <span style="color:#f3edab;">Saturn</span>, are gas giants,
                    being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, <span style="color:#c0fdf7;">Uranus</span> and <span style="color:#2fc9f7;">Neptune</span>, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane.
                    All eight planets have nearly circular orbits that lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, called the <span style="color: red;">Ecliptic</span>.</p>

                <p>There are more planets than stars in our galaxy. The current count orbiting our star: eight.
                    The inner, rocky planets are <span style="color:#adcb9d;">Mercury</span>, <span style="color:#efdf4f;">Venus</span>, <span style="color:#0a7bef;">Earth</span>, and <span style="color:#f17923;">Mars</span>. NASA's newest rover — Perseverance — landed on Mars on Feb. 18, 2021.
                    The outer planets are gas giants <span style="color:#e1cb61;">Jupiter</span> and <span style="color:#f3edab;">Saturn</span> and ice giants <span style="color:#c0fdf7;">Uranus</span> and <span style="color:#2fc9f7;">Neptune</span>.
                    Beyond Neptune, a newer class of smaller worlds called dwarf planets reign, including longtime favorite <span style="color:#2c049b;">Pluto</span>.
                    Thousands more planets have been discovered beyond our solar system. Scientists call them exoplanets (exo means "from outside").</p>

                    <h1>Simplified explanation:</h1>
                    <p>
                        There is a lot of theories  about  our galaxy , like Greek philosophers , they thought that the earth is flat  , and they also thought  that  the  Earth, the center  of  the solar system and the sun revolves around it (By the way , they didn’t discover other planets  that  time).
                        After that many theories appeared about our solar system , and in the Islamic age , one of the Muslim astronomers discovered that the Earth is spherical , and he also discovered that the sun is the center of the universe , and the earth revolves around it , in orbits , and each planet revolves in his orbit around the sun (By the way , that Muslim astronomer , invented a telescope and with it he had founded planets like , Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , Saturn , and maybe Uranus and Neptune ).
